# SwiftUI Catalog
An open source catalog, under MIT License, containing components, controls, effects, styles, layouts, containers, modifiers and accessibility elements you can use to develop SwiftUI Interfaces in iOS and iPadOS.


We'd like to promote this as a collaborative initiative developed over time, you're very welcomed to join the catalog with your contributions or to make use of the code which has been already created and shared.

# Goal
There's plenty of documentation and examples showing how to use SwiftUI, but apart from the official documentation I could not find one source of code where all the possible elements of SwiftUI are showcased clearly together. 

For example all the possible containers (like form, group, groupBox, controlGroup), all the hierarchical views (such as tabs view, outline views, diclosure views). 


This catalog will allow developers who already know the theoretical aspects of [data / state handling](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/state-and-data-flow) and SwiftUI [App Structure and Behaviour](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/app-structure-and-behavior) to discover and reused easily UI elements to compose SwiftUI Interfaces.

# You can use this catalog for:

- Discovering SwiftUI controls, layouts, containers, gestures (for iPadOS and iOS)
- Copy and paste the code you need into your (also commercial) projects (that's why I have chosen MIT License so the source code here can be freely shared, as long as an attribution is displayed)
- Contributing to some of the sections and share your code with others (see below "How to contribute?"
- Quickly launch the example app and see the components in real time
- Being able to share with your designers or product owners the possibilities with SwiftUI with the demo App.

# Do not use this catalog for:
- Learning SwiftUI, you need to have already an understanding of how it works, since there is no theory included in this project.
- Seeing how data handling works, since the catalog focuses on UI, not in data states.

# How to contribute?
- Select a VIEW you want to develop (example "toggles" or "sliders")
- Check if it is free to take (no other PR is made)
- Create a branch named like the VIEW you want to contribute to (the name is the one you see when you run the demo App, example "toggles")
- Replace this section "{ YOUR NAME HERE üèÜ }" with your name. Commit it.
- Inmediately create a DRAFT Pull Request (So other can see it's taken)
- Develop
- Convert the DRAFT to an OPEN Pull Request
- I'll review and merge your PR

If you have any other suggestion or wish regarding this catalog please open an ISSUE and we can discuss it there.
